## ✨ Features
- **Community Presets:** `crepeYay` is hardcoded and ready to go.

- **Customizable:** Add your own emotes via the Maintenance Tools and save a permanent local copy.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts
React faster than the speed of chat:
- **`1`** : +1
- **`2`** : +5
- **`3`** : +10
- **`4`** : +25
- **`0`** : Reset count to 0
- **`Enter`** : Copy spam string to clipboard

## 🛠 How to Add Custom Emotes
1. Open the **Maintenance Tools** section at the bottom.
2. Enter an **Emote Name** and a **GIF URL**.
   - **Tip:** Right-click an emote in Twitch chat and select "Copy Image Link".
   - **Tip:** In Chatterino, right-click an emote and select "Copy -> 1x link".
3. Click **Add to Grid**.
4. To make these emotes permanent, click **Download Updated File**. This generates a new `.html` file with your layout hardcoded into the source.
